## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### WhatsApp URL Format
```
https://wa.me/PHONENUMBER?text=MESSAGE
```

### Example URLs
```bash
# Basic contact
https://wa.me/254700000000

# With pre-filled message
https://wa.me/254700000000?text=Hi!%20I%20need%20a%20plumber

# Service-specific message
https://wa.me/254700000000?text=Hello!%20I%20found%20you%20through%20FundiConnect%20and%20need%20electrical%20work
```

### QR Code Generation
- Uses **QR Server API** (free service)
- Generates high-quality PNG images
- Customizable size and colors

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Phone Number Format
```bash
✅ Correct: +254700000000
❌ Wrong: 0700000000
❌ Wrong: 254-700-000-000
❌ Wrong: +254 700 000 000
```

### 2. Message Guidelines
- **Keep it short** - Mobile screens are small
- **Be specific** - "I need plumbing help" vs "Hi"
- **Include context** - "Found you through FundiConnect"
- **Professional tone** - First impression matters

### 3. QR Code Placement
- **High contrast background** - Ensure QR code is visible
- **Appropriate size** - Not too small to scan
- **Clear instructions** - "Scan to message me on WhatsApp"
- **Test before printing** - Always verify it works
